Gizmo
============

**Gizmo** is a simple page model testing framework that aims to DRY up feature testing assertions by abstracting code that defines your page, resulting in a consistent, easy to maintain test suite.

This code was created by [icaruswings](https://github.com/icaruswings) and other contributors from [realestate.com.au](http://www.realestate.com.au).

Install
------------

Add to your application's Gemfile or run:

`gem install gizmo`


Usage
------------
* [with Cucumber](http://wiki.github.com/icaruswings/gizmo/cucumber)
* [with RSpec](http://wiki.github.com/icaruswings/gizmo/rspec)


Contributing
------------
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Make sure you write tests. Pull requests will not be accepted unless they have complete coverage.
* Commit, do not mess with Rakefile, VERSION, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request.
